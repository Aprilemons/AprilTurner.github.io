                        works is that the clover will effectively proc the
                        missiles almost twice as often
                        (if theres a 10% chance for missiles to proc, and you have one clover, there is
                        a 19% chance for the missiles to proc).<br>
                        Eventually the missiles and will start to proc off of themselves, and you end up with a near a
                        constant stream of missiles,
                        which will automatically track down and kill everything on the stage.</td>

                        gasoline, (ideally 30-40), every enemy on the stage will die before you even see them. the best
                        part is that Gesture of the Drowned will activate FMP for you, meaning you

                        This combo relies on getting critical hits, so it's ideal to stack 10 Lens-Maker&apos;s Glasses

                        insticts as you can find, as more stacks will increase the amount by which your attack speed
                        will increase. Then, by shooting an enemy, your attack
                        speed will get faster and faster over time, with each hit causing plasma shrimp and I.C.B.M to
                        shoot out a ridiculous amount of missiles at the target,
                        which then bleeds and explodes due to shatterspleen.

                        This combo uses the equipment Remote Caffeinator, which summons an interactable you can
                        activate, to repeatedly activate your Squid Polyps and Fireworks, as well as healing you and the
                        Squid Turrets
                        continually with both Remote Caffeinator and Bustling Fungus. The way the game deals with the
                        Squid Turrets 30 second duration is by making them slowly lose health over time until they hit 0
                        and dissapear.
                        So by healing them continuously, they can last for as long as you hold still and interact with
                        the Remote Caffeinator. I like this combo's name because theres a constant flow of drinks,
                        fireworks and
                        mushrooms, just like a good party.
