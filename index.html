                My name is April and I really like the game
                Risk of Rain 2. So I have made this website, which provides
                details about some of my favorite item combinations in the
                game.

                                Risk of Rain 2 (or ROR2 for short) is a roguelike
                                third person shooter made by Hopoo Games and published
                                by Gearbox Publishing. It takes place on a fictional
                                planet called Petrichor V, where you play as a survivor
                                on a planet where everything is trying to kill you.<br>
                                The basic gameplay consists of killing aliens to get money,
                                then using that money to open chests, which contain randomized
                                items of varying degrees of rarity. Depending on which
                                items you pick up, you can gain stat bonuses or a variety
                                of effects that drastically change the nature of your
                                playthrough. It is a roguelike game, which means that when you
                                die, all your progress and items are lost and you start each
                                run from scratch.

                                ROR2 is a third person shooter, whereas the first installment
                                of the game, Risk of Rain, is a side scrolling platformer. They
                                are similar in many ways, each containing many of the same items
                                and survivors, but each version varies slightly in both the items
                                available and their effects.

                            <dt><b>Why did I choose this topic for the project?</b></dt>
                            <dd>
                                I figured this project would be easier if I picked
                                a topic I'm already familiar with. I could talk about ROR2
                                for hours, so the choice was obvious. <br>
                                In hindsight, I should have picked something I didnt care as much about so I wasted less time doing things that don't matter and just finished the assignment.
